<p>
	Construction in New York came to a screeching halt in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, which left many looking to socially distance outdoors finding more and more issues with their local parks.  
</p>

<iframe title="Capital Projects in NYC Parks" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-jBxn4" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jBxn4/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="688"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>
</div>

<p>
	Queens, the second most populous borough, has the most capital projects (renovation or construction) either underway and completed, while Staten Island, lowest in population, has the least. While the data provided by the NYC parks department shows over 2,000 projects started since the end of 2019, many are saying it’s not enough.
</p>

<p>
	Kevin Wisniewski is a senior advisor under assemblyman Andrew Hevesi, of Assembly District 28 in New York. Their office recently secured $500,000 in funding for a park in Ridgewood, and to seek out other Queens parks that need funding or repairs.
</p>

<p>
	“We actually had capital funding that was available at the time, so just purely for reasons of expediency, we figured this was the way to go,” said Wisniewski. “It takes more than just throwing money at the problem. People need to go show up and actually make a difference.”
